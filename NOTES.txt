Algorithms to implement
- From Bishop's book
	- Least Squares (+Regularized) for Regression and Classification
	- Iterated Weighted Least Squares	
	- Linear Discriminant Analysis	
	- ML Gaussian for classification
	- Logistic Regression (implemented in neural_networks)
	- Neural networks backprop (implemented)
		- generalize to different types of hidden and output units?
	- Message Passing
	- Gaussian Processes
	- Nonparametric Bayesian models: Chinese Restaurant, Indian Buffet, Dirichlet Process
