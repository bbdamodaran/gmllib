# gmllib - Machine learning library
This library implements various machine learning methods. The purpose here is mostly educational (for my own and hopefully others') 
and I aim for clarity rather than efficiency. Note that this is a work in progress!
So far the library contains implementations for
- Multilayer Perceptrons
- Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Belief Networks (with support for GPUs through gnumpy)
- k-Means clustering
- Principal Components Analysis
